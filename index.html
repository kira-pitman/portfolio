            <h3>Fowl Weather ü™ø</h3> <p>MVP In Progress</p>
            <p>
              Weather app using external API from API Ninja. This is a chance to brush up on my Full-Stack development skills, and also use an external API - something I haven't done in an individual project, so am looking forward to tackling the debugging challenges myself! MVP requires full front end accessibility along with being able to search for location based weather forcasets. Stretch will include 75% backend testing coverage, as well as a dive into three.js modelling of different fowl for an fun visuals depending on weather in location.

              2D platformer game made with assistance of an online step through tutorial for the basics. Developed through Unity/UnityHub and utilising C# for logic. Features include: movement, jumping, wall jumping and slide, shooting, enemies and traps, a basic stats system, and several levels.

            <p>
              Full stack application to keep track of my plants at home! Includes information about plant such as height, location, image, and facts. Able to both add and delete plants as wanted. Part of the requirements for my Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp where we had to create a full-stack website using react and typescript and successfully deploy it. This has now expanded into a personal project to develop and maintain my full-stack website development knowledge I learnt in my bootcamp. Beyond the basics, this is also been stretched to include plant editing, authentication, responsiveness, and a minimum 75% server side testing coverage.

            <p>
              This was my final group project for the Dev Academy Aotearoa bootcamp. I worked in a team with 5 others, and was the agile facilitator for the project. I allocated work and timelines using sprints, stand-ups, and allocating technical tickets as required. We managed to finish our project half a day early, with over 80% testing coverage, and having it fully deployed. My technical contributions were in the front-end react components in regards to functionality, as well as front-end authentication and website deployment. Tifff's Donuts is a project that lets you design and customize your own adorable donuts. Tools used include 
              TailwindCSS,
              React (Vite),
              React Router,
              ThreeJS / React Three Fiber / Drei,
              Auth0,
              SuperAgent,
              Vitest, and
              PlayWright.

            <p>Complete</p>
            <p>
              This is the first website I ever made at the end of June 2023. Static and only employing HTML and CSS, this blog made during week 2 of the initial 6 week remote section of my Dev Academy Aotearoa coursework, "foundations", shows where I started in my web development journey. Although not a reflection of my current tech stack, it demonstrates the growth and learning I went through during my course, as well as an indicator of what I can achieve in the right environment.
